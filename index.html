          <h2>Transmit Only Receiver Placement</h2>

<p>Transmit-Only (TO) sensor networks enable smaller and cheaper sensors,
reduced energy consumption, and simpler over-the-air protocols.  The challenge
in these networks is to ensure that the vast majority (over 99%) of packets
sent from a sensor actually reach a network sink.  To assist in analyzing the
possibilities of receiver placements, this project simulates placing receivers
at various locations within the sensor network in order to minimize lost
packets due to collisions.</p>

<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>The code is built most easily with <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Apache
Maven</a>.  In the main directory, just type:
<pre><code>mvn clean package</code></pre>
and the code should compile itself.  If not, send me a message and I'll see if
I can't get it working.

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>Once you've compiled the code with maven, your <code>target</code>
directory should have at least 2 JAR archives: with dependencies and without.
The simplest way to execute the application is the jar-with-dependencies
archive.  It takes a single parameter, a configuration file (a <a
href="https://github.com/romoore/jun-simulate/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.xml">sample is
included</a>) which holds all of the runtime parameters.  If your
configuration file is "myconfig.xml", then run the application like this:
<pre><code>java -jar jun-simulate-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar myconfig.xml</code></pre>
you should see output on the console almost immediately.</p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>
<p> The screenshots below are available when the configuration parameter
<code>generateImages</code> is set to <code>true</code>. The simulator will
generate 1920x1080 px PNG images any time it finds a coverage below 99.9% when
a large number of receivers are required (more than half the number of
transmitters).</p>

<p>The meaning of the different components isn't exactly clear unless you
understand the algorithm, but some of them look cool (at least for math), so I
thought I would include them as a little treat.</p>

<h3>Screenshot Legend</h3>
<ul>
  <li>White "T" - Barely visible unless you look, this is the location of the
  transmitters.</li>
  <li>Blue "R" - This is where a receiver was chosen to be placed.  The number
  next to it indicates how many capture disks contain it. For example, "R80"
  means that the point is contained in 80 capture disks.</li>
  <li>Green Dots - These are the centers and intersection points of the
  capture disks.  These are treated as possible solution points for placing
  receivers, and each one is evaluated.  The ones shown in the screenshots were
  not chosen.</li>
  <li>Red Circles - These are capture disks that don't include any chosen
  receivers.  This is what I was looking for when I wrote the visualization,
  because I wanted to see why the coverage rate was so low even with a lot of
  receivers.</li>
  <li>Yellow Lines - These originate at the receiver locations and terminate
  at the centers of the capture disks that contain the receiver.</li>
</ul>
