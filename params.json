The challenge in these networks is to ensure that the vast majority (over 99%) of packets sent from a sensor actually reach a network sink.  To assist in analyzing the possibilities of receiver placements, this project simulates placing receivers at various locations within the sensor network in order to minimize lost packets due to collisions.\r\n\r\n## How to Use ##\r\n\r\n## Screenshots ##","name":"Pretty Good Receiving","google":""}
