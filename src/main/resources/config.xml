            computation. 
       * "grid" - produces a grid of points to test rather than looking
                  at circle intersections. 
       * "recursive" - produces a grid of points, but uses recursion to
                       try to find a "good" maximum. 
       * "fair" - uses an adaptive grid, but tries to find the "fairest" placement
                  to maximize the number of transmitters with improved contention.

  <!-- How the transmitter locations should be generated.  Options include:

			   clustered, and clustering is within 20% (0.2) units of the average
				 dimensions of the simulation (height+widht)/2 from some other 
				 transmitter. 
			 * "rectangled 1" - randomly distributed transmitters within a rectangle of
			   some "width", defined from the outside edge of the transmitter square. 
			 * "circled 1" - randomly distributed transmitters within an ellipse of
				 some "width", defined from the outside edge of the transmitter square. 
			 * "sine 1" - randomly distributed transmitters along a "sine" wave within
				 the coordinate space.  The numeric value is the radius of the sine curve.
			 * "dumbbell 1" - randomly distributed transmitters within a "dumbbell" shape
				 separated by a "bar" of specified length (1 in this case). 
			 * "plus .5" - randomly distributed transmitters along a plus sign (+) with
				 some percentage width from the center. 
			 * "2-holes .5" - randomly distributed receivers within the entire coordinate
				 space, but excluding 2 circles of relative size. ".5" would mean that each circle
				 is one-half of half the coordinate dimensions (quarter-width or quarter-height).
